# GitHub Copilot Agent Skills

This directory contains **Agent Skills** for GitHub Copilot, providing structured, reusable patterns and best practices for this repository.

## 📚 What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are structured folders of instructions that teach GitHub Copilot to perform specialized, repeatable tasks following your team's specific patterns, coding standards, and best practices. Skills are automatically loaded by Copilot when relevant context is detected.

**Introduced:** December 18, 2025

## 🔄 How Skills Work

### Automatic Activation
Skills are automatically loaded by GitHub Copilot when:
1. You work in this repository
2. Your prompt or context matches the skill's domain

### Skill Structure
Each skill follows this directory structure:
```
.github/skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main skill file with YAML frontmatter
├── examples/          # Code examples (optional)
│   └── example.tsx
├── templates/         # Reusable templates (optional)
│   └── template.tsx
└── docs/             # Additional documentation (optional)
    └── patterns.md
```

### SKILL.md Format
```markdown

# Skill Name

## Context
When this skill applies and why it's needed.

## Rules
1. Clear, actionable rule
2. Another specific rule
3. More enforcement patterns

## Examples
Concrete examples showing correct implementation.

## Anti-Patterns
What NOT to do, with explanations.
```

## 🎯 Skill vs Agent vs Custom Instructions

Understanding the hierarchy:

| Type | Scope | Purpose | Location |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Skills** | Specific patterns/rules | Teach Copilot reusable patterns | `.github/skills/` |
| **Agents** | Domain expertise | Specialized roles for different tasks | `.github/agents/` |
| **Custom Instructions** | Project-wide | General repository guidelines | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |

**Mental Model:**
- **Custom Instructions** = Project-level defaults (e.g., "Use TypeScript strict mode")
- **Agents** = Specialized experts (e.g., `game-developer` for Three.js work)
- **Skills** = Reusable patterns and rules (e.g., "How to test Three.js components")

### Example Workflow
```
Developer: "Add a new Three.js particle system with proper testing"

Copilot applies:
1. Custom Instructions → TypeScript strict mode, project structure
2. Agent → game-developer (Three.js expertise)
3. Skills → react-threejs-game (patterns) + testing-strategy (test patterns)
```

## 🛠️ Creating New Skills

### When to Create a Skill
Create a skill when you have:
- ✅ Repeatable patterns that should be consistent across the codebase
- ✅ Best practices that are often forgotten or done incorrectly
- ✅ Complex workflows that require specific steps
- ✅ Domain-specific rules that apply to certain contexts

### Skill Design Principles
1. **Strategic and High-Level** - Focus on principles, not implementation details
2. **Rule-Based** - Clear, enforceable rules that Copilot can follow
3. **Security-First** - Always consider security implications
4. **ISMS-Aligned** - Reference relevant Hack23 policies
5. **Examples-Driven** - Show correct patterns with concrete examples
6. **Minimal** - Keep skills focused on one domain

### Creating a New Skill
1. Create directory: `.github/skills/skill-name/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with proper YAML frontmatter
3. Add examples in `examples/` subdirectory
4. Test the skill by using Copilot in relevant contexts
5. Update this README with the new skill

- Write clear, specific rules that are easy to follow
- Include concrete examples showing correct implementation
- Reference relevant documentation and policies
- Keep skills focused on one domain or pattern
- Use simple language without jargon
- Test skills by using Copilot in relevant contexts

### ❌ Don't
- Make skills too broad or generic
- Include implementation details that change frequently
- Duplicate content from custom instructions or agents
- Use overly technical language without explanation
